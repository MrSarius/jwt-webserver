With this project I have deepened my C++ knowledge. In particular, I had to brush up on my Cmake skills for the project. I also found it interesting to look at a protocol like HTTP from a low-level perspective.

The entire project (both the general and system tasks) was challenging.
However, I found it especially challenging to connect the two projects at the end. I also did not get over 117% on the auto tester until the end because it always threw an exception when trying to test the frontend worker. However, in the deployed React App everything works fine.
When a user posts something for the first time under his username, a JWT token is created and forwarded. If the same username posts something again, this only works if he sends a valid JWT token.
No errors appear in the error log of my worker while the tester is running.

Regarding the extra credits:
- Implemented Emoji Reactions in the general assignment.
- /README.txt route has been implemented in the system assignment.
- System assignment and general assignment have been successfully merged. As described above, I don't know exactly why the tester throws an error, however everything works fine from within the React app.

Best regards,
Ben
